# Data

The data we used for study and research is obtained from General social survey on Family (cycle 31), 2017, from the Canadian General Social Survey (GSS). This microdata was retrieved from the University of Toronto Database CHASS (Computing the Humanities and Social Sciences), in which the data was provided by Statistics Canada. All the data we used are already cleaned and the original data is not included, thus we are not allowed to share it.

# Overview of Paper

In the paper, we discussed, analyzed and visualized the distribution of the data set pulled out from General social survey on Family (cycle 31), 2017. We also created a supplementary survey for further investigation on the factors that influence people's mental health. We inspected the methodology of the survey and then conducted an analysis of the mental health based on different segmentation of the respondents. Alongside, the weakness of the survey and the next steps are provided in the paper for future improvement of the survey. We concluded with an appendix that included all the questions and options of the survey, followed by references of the paper.
